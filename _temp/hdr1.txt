<b>Greybox Program Synthesis: A New Approach to Attack Dataflow Obfuscation</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: Blackhat USA, Las Vegas, Nevada, 2021. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/BHUSA2021-David-Greybox-Program-Synthesis.pdf">slide</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Robin David<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>This talk presents the latest advances in program synthesis applied for deobfuscation. It aims at demystifying this analysis technique
 by showing how it can be put into action on obfuscation. Especially the implementation Qsynthesis released for this talk shows a complete end-to-end workflow
 to deobfuscate assembly instructions back in optimized (deobfuscated) instructions reassembled back in the binary.</em>

<b>From source code to crash test-case through software testing automation</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: C&ESAR, Rennes, France, 2021. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/CESAR2021_robin-david-paper.pdf">paper</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/CESAR2021_robin-david-slide.pdf">slide</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Robin David, Jonathan Salwan, Justin Bourroux<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>This paper present an approach automating the software testing process from a source code to the dynamic testing of the compiled program.  More specifically, from a static
 analysis report indicating alerts on source lines it enables testing to cover these lines dynamically and opportunistically checking whether  whether or not they can trigger
 a crash. The result is a test corpus allowing to cover alerts and to trigger them if they happen to be true positives. This paper discuss the  methodology employed to track
 alerts down in the compiled binary, the testing engines selection process and the results obtained on a TCP/IP stack implementation for embedded  and IoT systems.</em>

<b>QSynth: A Program Synthesis based Approach for Binary Code Deobfuscation</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: BAR, San Diego, California, 2020. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/BAR2020-qsynth-robin-david.pdf">paper</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Robin David, Luigi Coniglio, Mariano Ceccato<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>We present a generic approach leveraging both DSE and program synthesis to successfully synthesize programs  obfuscated with Mixed-Boolean-Arithmetic, Data-Encoding
 or Virtualization. The synthesis algorithm proposed is an offline enumerate synthesis primitive guided by top-down breath-first search.  We shows its effectiveness
 against a state-of-the-art obfuscator and its scalability as it supersedes other similar approaches based on synthesis. We also show its effectiveness in presence of
 composite obfuscation (combination of various techniques). This ongoing work enlightens the effectiveness of synthesis to target certain kinds of obfuscations and
 opens the way to more robust algorithms and simplification strategies.</em>

<b>Sydr: Cutting Edge Dynamic Symbolic Execution</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: Ivannikov ISP RAS Open Conference, Moscow, Russia, 2020. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/ISPRAS2020-sydr.pdf">paper</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: A.Vishnyakov, A.Fedotov, D.Kuts, A.Novikov, D.Parygina, E.Kobrin, V.Logunova, P.Belecky, S.Kurmangaleev<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) has enormous amount of applications in computer  security (fuzzing, vulnerability discovery, reverse-engineering, etc.). We propose
 several performance and accuracy improvements for dynamic symbolic execution.  Skipping non-symbolic instructions allows to build a path predicate 1.2--3.5 times faster.
 Symbolic engine simplifies formulas during symbolic execution. Path  predicate slicing eliminates irrelevant conjuncts from solver queries. We handle each jump table
 (switch statement) as multiple branches and describe the method for symbolic execution of multi-threaded programs. The proposed solutions were implemented in Sydr tool.
 Sydr performs inversion of branches in path predicate. Sydr combines DynamoRIO dynamic binary instrumentation tool with Triton symbolic engine.</em>

<b>Symbolic Deobfuscation: From Virtualized Code Back to the Original</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: DIMVA, Paris-Saclay, France, 2018. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/DIMVA2018-deobfuscation-salwan-bardin-potet.pdf">paper</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/DIMVA2018-slide-deobfuscation-salwan-bardin-potet.pdf">slide</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Sébastien Bardin, Marie-Laure Potet<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>Software protection has taken an important place during the last decade in order to protect legit software against reverse engineering or tampering.
 Virtualization is considered as one of the very best defenses against such attacks. We present a generic approach based on symbolic path exploration, taint and
 recompilation allowing to recover, from a virtualized code, a devirtualized code semantically identical to the original one and close in size. We define criteria
 and metrics to evaluate the relevance of the deobfuscated results in terms of correctness and precision. Finally we propose an open-source setup allowing to evaluate
 the proposed approach against several forms of virtualization.</em>

 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Sébastien Bardin, Marie-Laure Potet<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>In this presentation we describe an approach which consists to automatically analyze virtual machine based software protections and which recompiles a new
 version of the binary without such protections. This automated approach relies on a symbolic execution guide by a taint analysis and some concretization policies, then
 on a binary rewriting using LLVM transition.</em>

<b>How Triton can help to reverse virtual machine based software protections</b><br />
 <b>Talk at</b>: CSAW SOS, NYC, New York, 2016. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/CSAW2016-SOS-Virtual-Machine-Deobfuscation-RThomas_JSalwan.pdf">slide</a>]<br />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Romain Thomas<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>The first part of the talk is going to be an introduction to the Triton framework to expose its components and to explain how they work together.
 Then, the second part will include demonstrations on how it's possible to reverse virtual machine based protections using taint analysis, symbolic execution, SMT
 simplifications and LLVM-IR optimizations.</em>

<b>Dynamic Binary Analysis and Obfuscated Codes</b><br  />
 <b>Talk at</b>: St'Hack, Bordeaux, France, 2016. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/StHack2016_Dynamic_Binary_Analysis_and_Obfuscated_Codes_RThomas_JSalwan.pdf">slide</a>]<br  />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Romain Thomas<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>At this presentation we will talk about how a DBA (Dynamic Binary Analysis) may help a reverse engineer to reverse obfuscated code. We will first
 introduce some basic obfuscation techniques and then expose how it's possible to break some stuffs (using our open-source DBA framework - Triton) like detect opaque
 predicates, reconstruct CFG, find the original algorithm, isolate sensible data and many more... Then, we will conclude with a demo and few words about our future work.</em>

<b>How Triton may help to analyse obfuscated binaries</b><br  />
 <b>Publication at</b>: MISC magazine 82, 2015. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/MISC-82_French_Paper_How_Triton_may_help_to_analyse_obfuscated_binaries_RThomas_JSalwan.pdf">french article</a>]<br  />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Romain Thomas<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>Binary obfuscation is used to protect software's intellectual property. There exist different kinds of obfucation but roughly, it transforms a binary
 structure into another binary structure by preserving the same semantic. The aim of obfuscation is to ensure that the original information is "drown" in useless information
 that will make reverse engineering harder. In this article we will show how we can analyse an ofbuscated program and break some obfuscations using the Triton framework.</em>

 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan, Florent Saudel<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>This talk is about the release of Triton, a concolic execution framework based on Pin. It provides components like a taint engine, a dynamic symbolic execution
 engine, a snapshot engine, translation of x64 instruction to SMT2, a Z3 interface to solve constraints and Python bindings. Based on these components, Triton offers the possibility
 to build tools for vulnerabilities research or reverse-engineering assistance.</em>

<b>Dynamic Behavior Analysis Using Binary Instrumentation</b><br  />
 <b>Talk at</b>: St'Hack, Bordeaux, France, 2015. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/StHack2015_Dynamic_Behavior_Analysis_using_Binary_Instrumentation_Jonathan_Salwan.pdf">slide</a>]<br  />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>This talk can be considered like the part 2 of our talk at SecurityDay. In the previous part, we talked about how it was possible to cover a targeted function
 in memory using the DSE (Dynamic Symbolic Execution) approach. Cover a function (or its states) doesn't mean find all vulnerabilities, some vulnerability doesn't crashes the program.
 That's why we must implement specific analysis to find specific bugs. These analysis are based on the binary instrumentation and the runtime behavior analysis of the program. In this
 talk, we will see how it's possible to find these following kind of bugs : off-by-one, stack / heap overflow, use-after-free, format string and {write, read}-what-where.</em>

<b>Covering a function using a Dynamic Symbolic Execution approach</b><br  />
 <b>Talk at</b>: Security Day, Lille, France, 2015. [<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton/tree/master/publications/SecurityDay2015_dynamic_symbolic_execution_Jonathan_Salwan.pdf">slide</a>]<br  />
 <b>Auhtors</b>: Jonathan Salwan<br />
 <b>Abstract</b>: <em>This talk is about binary analysis and instrumentation. We will see how it's possible to target a specific function, snapshot the context memory/registers before the
 function, translate the instrumentation into an intermediate representation,apply a taint analysis based on this IR, build/keep formulas for a Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE), generate
 a concrete value to go through a specific path, restore the context memory/register and generate another concrete value to go through another path then repeat this operation until the
 target function is covered.</em>
